Attached are sample JavaScript files (train1.js, badusb_demo.js, blebeacon.js, disk.js, event_loop.js, gui.js, i2c-spi.js, interactive.js, spi.js, subghz.js, flipper_http_example.js, flipper_http_enhanced.js, flipper_http_simple_ping.js, flipper_http_cat_fact.js) that work on the Flipper Zero. Flipper Zero JavaScript is based on the mJS engine, which is fairly restricted version of JavaScript.  You should only use functions defined in the training file, no additional built-in commands are supported.  You should not redefine any function that is used in the training file. Please see the comments in train1.js file for more details.

The FlipperHTTP module provides comprehensive Internet connectivity:

- Binary data requests with get_request_bytes() for images/files
- WiFi connection management (connect, disconnect, scan, save credentials)
- JSON data parsing from API responses
- Enhanced WebSocket connections using SOCKET/START and SOCKET/STOP
- IP address retrieval for both WiFi and board
- LED control during processing
- Improved error handling and buffer management

Available FlipperHTTP files:
- flipper_http_example.js: Complete demo with GUI and all features
